## Setting up Lab9

**Synopsis:** For this lab we will extend the introduction to MQTT and IoT edge
devices by connecting to the UW/instructor provisioned Microsoft Azure cloud
system and the Azure IoT Suite.  We will perform manual connections to an MQTT
Broker on the Azure cloud, provision security certificates, connect to the Azure
IoT Hub, perform a basic Stream Analytics function and Utilize the Power BI
visualization toolkit to graph data from multiple IoT devices.

### Objectives
* Install MQTT Message Broker on an Azure Ubuntu VM
* Generate Certificates for IoT End Devices or Gateways
* Connect our IoT Gateway code to Azure IoT Hub
* Stream data through Stream Analytics
* Perform Visualization using Power BI


The various steps of this lab are summarized as:
* [PART A](https://gitlab.com/iot110/iot110-student/blob/master/Labs/Lab9/PartA.md) Install MQTT Message Broker on an Azure Ubuntu VM
* [PART B](https://gitlab.com/iot110/iot110-student/blob/master/Labs/Lab9/PartB.md) Generate Certificates for IoT End Devices or Gateways
* [PART C](https://gitlab.com/iot110/iot110-student/blob/master/Labs/Lab9/PartC.md) Create MQTT Python Test Code
* [PART D](https://gitlab.com/iot110/iot110-student/blob/master/Labs/Lab9/PartD.md) Test Multiple Pub/Sub Connections
